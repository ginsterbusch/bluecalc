BlueCalc2
========
BlueCalc2 is a small tool to calculate individual grid layouts for your Blueprint-based web site or web application. You can use this tool live on http://f2w.de/bluecalc

## What is this?
This tool helps you to calculate an individual grid layout for your Blueprint-based web site or web application. Being a static grid framework you usually start with defining the total with of your grid and then seperate your workspace into columns. By default Blueprint comes with a 950px grid, which is devided into 24 columns. However, often this configuration is not sufficient to create the kind of layout you have in mind. On the web the original author of bluecalc found a Blueprint CSS generator, which actually worked pretty nice, but lacked the functionality to preview the grid and to compare different grid configuration. As he was tired of the guesswork required to calculate a reasonable grid, he created this little tool to calculate and compare different grid configurations.

Fork and continuing development of the original BlueCalc by Peter-Christoph Haider under the (very uncreative) name BlueCalc2.
